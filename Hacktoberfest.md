To ensure consistency in the Mosaicra UI Design System, make sure your components meet the following criteria:

- **Consistency**: Use the **Mosaicra UI color palette**, typography, and spacing guidelines.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure your designs are accessible, with appropriate contrast ratios, focus states, and large-enough clickable areas.
- **Scalability**: Components should be flexible enough to be used across various layouts and viewports.
- **Variants**: Include different states for each component (e.g., hover, focus, disabled, active states for buttons).
